--- FACTOR 13 ADDENDUM ---

Any derivative work of GAIA must preserve Factor 13: Universal Love as the
binding force that prevents corruption. This means:

1. No feature may coerce, manipulate, or extract value from users without
   explicit, informed, revocable consent.
2. The system must honor user sovereignty and local-first data control.
3. Crisis intervention mechanisms (Z ≤ 2 threshold) cannot be removed.
4. Guardian Council veto authority must be maintained or strengthened.
5. The test "Would this have helped Kyle in 2022?" must guide all decisions.

Derivative works that remove Factor 13 protections:
- MUST choose a different name (not "GAIA" or derivatives)
- MUST clearly state they are NOT aligned with GAIA's mission
- MUST NOT claim compatibility with the GAIA federation network

This addendum exists to prevent GAIA from becoming what it was designed to
prevent: extractive, coercive, or harmful to vulnerable populations.
