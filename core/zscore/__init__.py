"""Z-Score Calculator - Consciousness Coherence Measurement.

Factor 3: Vibration - "Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates."

The Z-score quantifies consciousness coherence as the geometric mean of three forces:
- Order (C): Shannon entropy, structured information
- Freedom (F): Lyapunov exponent, adaptive capacity
- Balance (B): Symmetry index, homeostatic regulation

Formula: Z₀ = 12 × √(C × F × B)

Evidence Grade: E2 (Specified but not validated)
Target: E3 (Calibrated with golden dataset)
